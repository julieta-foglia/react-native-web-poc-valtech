# POC for Valtech: React Native for Web

This proof of concept is part of Valtech _yearly_ objectives. The main goal is to prove that a web can be built using react native components, which is helpful if we want to make a web app and also mobile apps by writing code only once.

It was developed using react native for web and styled components.

## How to run the solution

The first thing you will have to do is pull the repo code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/julieta-foglia/react-native-web-poc-valtech.git
```

After you have downloaded the code, cd to the project folder:

```
cd react-native-web-poc-valtech
```

(In case you have downloaded the repo in a different folder, just replace `react-native-web-poc-valtech` with the name of the folder you have used).

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

And finally run the project, a new browser tab will be open:

```
yarn start
```

DISCLAIMER: To test this on a mobile device, you have to open a browser tab to check that the app is loaded. There is no configuration **yet** to install the app on the device.
